# pumps-dataset
Task: Classification problem. Dataset containing information on 54,000 pumps to be classified as functional, functional but needing repair and non-functional. Dataset taken from kaggle and released by the Tanzanian Ministry of Water. Challenges: Categorical columns contain many unique values. Highly imbalanced class label.  Method: Lambda function to recategorize low frequency values in the categorical columns. Experimented with class weights to address the imbalance in the target variable. Set class weights to 'none' and 'balanced'.  Results (confusion matrix): The SVC algorithm which took balanced class weights was best at predicting the non-functional label. The one with class weights set to 'none' did best on the 'functional needs repair' label.
